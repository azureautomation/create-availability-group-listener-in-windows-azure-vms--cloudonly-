Create Availability Group Listener in Windows Azure VMs (Cloud-Only)
====================================================================

            
**NOTE: AlwaysOn Availability Groups in Windows Azure currently only supports listener creation in Window Server 2012 VMs.**

This script configures an availability group listener for an availability group that is running in Windows Azure VMs. This script is to be run on your local client from within a Windows Azure PowerShell window with administrative privileges. It automatically
 configures the Windows Azure settings and also configures each VM remotely using PowerShell remoting.

**ACTION SUMMARY**

  *  Validate the specified parameters 
  *  Validate your configuration 
  *  Create public load-balanced endpoints for the VMs with Direct Server Return (DSR) enabled

  *  Manually configure a client access point in the cluster 
  *  Configure the listener port in SQL Server 

**PREREQUISITES**


**NOTE: **If your VMs do not satisfy the prerequisites here, see alternative PowerShell methods at [http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlalwayson/archive/2013/08/06/availability-group-listener-in-windows-azure-now-supported-and-scripts-for-cloud-only-configuration.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sqlalwayson/archive/2013/08/06/availability-group-listener-in-windows-azure-now-supported-and-scripts-for-cloud-only-configuration.aspx).


  *  Windows Azure PowerShell June 2013 or later installed on the local client. Download at
[http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9811175&clcid=0x409](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9811175&clcid=0x409).

  *  You have imported your Windows Azure subscription into your Windows Azure PowerShell session. To do this, run 'Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile' to download a management certificate to a local directory, and then run 'Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile -PublishSettingsFile
 <filepath>'. 
  *  All cluster VMs must belong to the same cloud service. 
  *  All cluster VMs must be running Windows Server 2012 with KB2854082 installed.

  *  All availability group nodes are running in Windows Azure and in the same subnet.

  *  The user specified in the -DomainAccount parameter must have the following permissions on the cluster VMs:

  *  local administrator 
  *  SQL Server sysadmin role 
  *  Full control of the cluster  

**BASIC SYNTAX**

If running PowerShell remote management for the first time, use the -InstallWinRMCert parameter:

To specify the name of the Azure endpoint ('ListenerEndpoint' by default):














        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
